# Installation

Just install the dependencies from the `dependencies.txt` file, and 
you're almost good to go.

There's just one little thing. You have to create a file called `config.py`
in the root of the project and create the `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`, 
`SPOTIFT_REDIRECT_URI` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` variables in it. Then you're good to go.
